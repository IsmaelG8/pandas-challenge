Project Overview:

As the newly appointed Chief Data Scientist for our city’s school district, I have been tasked with analyzing standardized test results across all schools to assist the school board and mayor in making informed decisions about future school budgets and strategic priorities. The analysis focuses on math and reading scores of students, along with additional school data, to identify trends and performance metrics that can guide policy-making.

Objective:

The objective of this project is to provide a clear, data-driven insight into how different schools are performing under various conditions and budget allocations. By aggregating and analyzing data on a district-wide scale, we aim to uncover patterns that can help optimize educational outcomes and resource distribution.

Technical Execution:

Data Preparation:

Cloned the project repository and set up a Jupyter Notebook environment for analysis.
Merged the mouse_metadata and study_results data into a single DataFrame to create a unified view of all student scores and school attributes.
District Summary:

Calculated the total number of schools, total student count, total budget, and average scores for math and reading.
Determined the percentage of students passing math, reading, and both subjects to provide a snapshot of district-wide academic achievement.
School Summary:

Compiled detailed metrics for each school, including type, number of students, budget per student, and average scores.
Calculated passing percentages for math, reading, and overall to evaluate each school’s performance.
Performance Analysis:

Identified top-performing and lowest-performing schools based on overall passing rates, providing specific insights into which schools are excelling or underperforming.
Analyzed math and reading scores by grade to assess academic progress and consistency across grade levels within schools.
Budget Analysis:

Categorized schools into spending ranges per student and analyzed their impact on average scores and passing rates, offering a nuanced view of how financial resources relate to student outcomes.
Examined school performance based on size and type to explore how these factors influence academic effectiveness.
Visualization:

Created bar charts and pie charts to visually represent data distributions and trends, enhancing the interpretability of findings.
Developed box plots to highlight statistical nuances in school performance data.
Key Findings:

Resource Allocation: Schools with higher budgets per student did not necessarily outperform others, indicating that simply increasing financial investment is not the sole answer to improving academic outcomes.
Size and Type: Smaller schools and charter schools generally showed better results, especially in overall passing rates, suggesting that student-teacher ratios and school management styles play significant roles in educational success.
Recommendations:

Targeted Interventions: Focus resources on underperforming schools, particularly large public schools that are struggling despite adequate funding.
Policy Adjustments: Reevaluate budget allocations to ensure that funds are used efficiently, potentially redirecting some resources towards teacher training and student support services.
Conclusion:

This comprehensive analysis provides the school board and city officials with actionable insights into how different factors affect school performance. By continuing to monitor these metrics and adapting strategies accordingly, we can strive to enhance educational outcomes across the district, ensuring that every student has the opportunity to succeed.

Future Directions:

Longitudinal Study: Implement a multi-year analysis to track changes over time and assess the long-term impact of policy changes.
Student Feedback: Incorporate student feedback into future analyses to understand their perspectives and improve engagement and satisfaction.
